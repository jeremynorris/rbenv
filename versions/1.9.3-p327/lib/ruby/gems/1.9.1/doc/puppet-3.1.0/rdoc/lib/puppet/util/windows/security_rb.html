      <h2>Description</h2>
      
<p>This class maps POSIX owner, group, and modes to the Windows security
model, and back.</p>

<p>The primary goal of this mapping is to ensure that owner, group, and modes
can be round-tripped in a consistent and deterministic way. Otherwise, <a
href="../../../../Puppet.html">Puppet</a> might think file resources are
out-of-sync every time it runs. A secondary goal is to provide equivalent
permissions for common use-cases. For example, setting the owner to
“Administrators”, group to “Users”, and mode to 750 (which also denies
access to everyone else.</p>

<p>There are some well-known problems mapping windows and POSIX permissions
due to differences between the two security models. Search for “POSIX
permission mapping leak”. In POSIX, access to a file is determined solely
based on the most specific class (user, group, other). So a mode of 460
would deny write access to the owner even if they are a member of the
group. But in Windows, the entire access control list is walked until the
user is explicitly denied or allowed (denied take precedence, and if
neither occurs they are denied). As a result, a user could be allowed
access based on their group membership. To solve this problem, other people
have used deny access control entries to more closely model POSIX, but this
introduces a lot of complexity.</p>

<p>In general, this implementation only supports “typical” permissions, where
group permissions are a subset of user, and other permissions are a subset
of group, e.g. 754, but not 467.  However, there are some Windows quirks to
be aware of.</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The owner can be either a user or group SID, and most system files are
owned by the Administrators group.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The group can be either a user or group SID.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Unexpected results can occur if the owner and group are the same, but the
user and group classes are different, e.g. 750. In this case, it is not
possible to allow write access to the owner, but not the group. As a
result, the actual permissions set on the file would be 770.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In general, only privileged users can set the owner, group, or change the
mode for files they do not own. In 2003, the user must be a member of the
Administrators group. In Vista/2008, the user must be running with elevated
privileges.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A file/dir can be deleted by anyone with the DELETE access right OR by
anyone that has the FILE_DELETE_CHILD access right for the parent. See <a
href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238018.">support.microsoft.com/kb/238018.</a>
But on Unix, the user must have write access to the file/dir AND execute
access to all of the parent path components.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Many access control entries are inherited from parent directories, and it
is common for file/dirs to have more than 3 entries, e.g. Users, Power
Users, Administrators, SYSTEM, etc, which cannot be mapped into the 3 class
POSIX model. The get_mode method will set the S_IEXTRA bit flag indicating
that an access control entry was found whose SID is neither the owner,
group, or other. This enables <a href="../../../../Puppet.html">Puppet</a>
to detect when file/dirs are out-of-sync, especially those that <a
href="../../../../Puppet.html">Puppet</a> did not create, but is attempting
to manage.</p>
</li><li>
<p>On Unix, the owner and group can be modified without changing the mode. But
on Windows, an access control entry specifies which SID it applies to. As a
result, the set_owner and set_group methods automatically rebuild the
access control list based on the new (and different) owner or group.</p>
